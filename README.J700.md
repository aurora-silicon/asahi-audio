# MacBook Neo J700 — speakers, headphones and microphones

This addition needs the matching J700 UCM entries from alsa-ucm-conf-asahi.
It is built from upstream f5b118a8a2fb150b145cb667b4738cdab0304eb0.

The J700 is set up like the other Asahi laptops. Users see these devices:

| Device | Node | Available |
|---|---|---|
| "MacBook Neo J700 Speakers" | `audio_effect.j700-convolver` (DSP sink) | always |
| "Built-in Audio Headphones" | UCM `Headphones` on `hw:AppleJ700,0` | while headphones are plugged in |
| "MacBook Neo J700 Microphone" | `effect_output.j700-mic` (DSP source) | always; the default microphone |
| "Built-in Audio Headset Microphone" | UCM `Headset` on `hw:AppleJ700,0` | while a headset is plugged in |

The raw speaker and microphone-array nodes are hidden behind their DSP
filters, the same way as on the other machines. The J700 rules are part of
`conf/wireplumber.conf`; there is no separate J700 configuration file.

## Speakers

`hw:AppleJ700,1` is the raw speaker device (one MAX98360A per channel on the
AOP's LEAP serializer, S32LE at 48 kHz only).  As on every other Mac the
generic rule renames it `alsa_output.platform-sound.RawSpeakers` and the
`node.software-dsp` rule wraps it in `firs/j700/graph.json`, which is the
user-visible "MacBook Neo J700 Speakers" sink.  The graph has the usual shape
(bankstown bass extension, equal-loudness compensation carrying the sink
volume, a convolver per channel, the woofer band compressor and the final
limiter).  `firs/j700/48.wav` is a first correction measured on the
machine: an exponential sine sweep (100 Hz - 7.5 kHz, -50 dBFS on the wire)
recorded by the internal low-power microphone and deconvolved; only the
broad presence peaks (1.6 kHz, 2.5-3.2 kHz) and the mild rise above 5 kHz
are corrected, by a few dB, as a minimum-phase 2048-tap IR.  The internal
microphone is not a listener position, so this is deliberately gentle and
should be replaced by a measurement in front of the laptop; the
bankstown/compressor settings are provisional for the same reason.  The
graph only lists 48 kHz because the hardware path is fixed at that rate.

The raw device reaches the amplifier's full scale (0 dBFS on the wire,
7.3 V peak) only while a speaker-protection daemon (speakerguardd) holds
the card's volume lock and governs "Speaker Playback Volume" with its
thermal model; without the daemon the kernel holds that control 20 dB
down.  The control is not a PipeWire route volume and is never touched by
this configuration.

At 100 % the graph alone takes, measured on the machine (a -20 dBFS tone
recorded at the graph's output, 2026-10-15): -1.5 dB at 1 kHz, -6.6 dB at
2.5 kHz and -4.4 dB at 5 kHz, mostly the correction's cut of the
presence peaks.  The convolvers therefore carry +3 dB of make-up gain
(`"gain": 1.41`), as on j413.  The compressor that ends the shared graph
shape (`woofer_lim`, 0 dBFS, 15:1, RMS detection) lets transients through:
with the make-up gain, a mastered-music-like test signal (-1 dBFS peak,
12 dB crest factor) left the graph at up to +3.5 dBFS, and the S32
conversion clipped 0.06 % of its samples (18 clip events a second).  A
brick-wall limiter (LSP limiter, -0.5 dBFS, 5 ms lookahead) after it
removes those overs (0 clipped samples) without costing level.  Measured
with the internal microphone, the result is 2.75 dB louder at 100 % than
without the make-up gain, with the same frequency response; speakerguardd
took no reduction during 60 s of the test signal at 100 % (0.84 W mean
per speaker).

The speaker sink comes back at the volume and mute state it last had,
every time it is created (at every boot and whenever WirePlumber
restarts).  The limits that protect the speakers are the kernel ceiling
and the speaker-protection daemon above, not the sink volume.
`asahi-restore-volume.lua` stores and restores the sink's channel volumes
and mute state in place of WirePlumber's stream state, which the graph
turns off for this sink with `state.restore-props = false` and hands over
with `asahi.restore-props = true`.  The first time, the sink gets the
volume and mute WirePlumber had stored for it.  With nothing stored, or a
stored volume that is not a number from 0 to 1 for each channel, it gets
`state.default-volume`, 0.027: 30 % on desktop volume sliders (cubic
scale), audible for a first notification without starting loud.

The script logs every change of the sink's volume or mute state to the
journal, one notice line per burst of changes (WirePlumber's default log
level shows notices), for example:

    audio_effect.j700-convolver: volume 0.10 -> 1.00, mute false -> false (1 change; another client; clients connected just before: wpctl (pid 4242); peak volume 1.00)

Volumes are shown as desktop sliders show them.  PipeWire does not say
which client set a parameter, so the line says whether the script's own
restore made the change and otherwise lists the PipeWire clients that
connected in the three seconds before it.  That names one-shot tools,
including PulseAudio clients such as `pactl`, which pipewire-pulse
connects as clients of their own.  A change made through a client that was
already connected, such as the desktop shell, shows no new client; the
time of the line then has to be matched against that client's own logs.

The change log keeps external bursts even when the volume and mute finish
where they started, and reports the peak volume reached during each burst.
A burst containing both a restore and an external change names both; only
an unchanged burst entirely due to restore is omitted.

### Excursion limiter (testing)

`firs/j700/graph-xlim.json` is the speaker graph with one more node at the
very end: `speakerguard-xlim`, a look-ahead limiter from speakerguardd
(its `filter/`, a LADSPA plugin).  It predicts the cone's displacement for
every sample from the driver's model (Bl 0.74 T m, Mms 0.16 g, Kms
1720 N/m, Rms 0.14 kg/s, Re 4.3 ohm, resonance at 522 Hz) at the
amplifier's full scale (7.30 and 7.33 V).  It lowers the gain just enough,
ahead of time, that the cone stays under 0.9 of the driver's 0.565 mm
displacement limit, and that no sample passes full scale.  Thermal and
power limits stay with speakerguardd, which still holds the card's volume
lock.  The limiter only ever lowers the gain, both channels together.
Below its limits the output is the input delayed, bit for bit.
Displacement binds only near full scale at low frequencies (at resonance
from about -9 dBFS on the wire).

It adds 351 frames (7.3 ms) of latency, inside a 352-frame budget, and
reports them to PipeWire.  Offline, against an independent model of the
cone, the worst of 87000 random programs and 172 worst-case shapes was
0.8956 of the limit.

It is not on by default.  `firs/j700/xlim-wireplumber.conf` selects it
when copied to `~/.config/wireplumber/wireplumber.conf.d/` and followed
by a restart of the user's WirePlumber and PipeWire.  Removing the copy
and restarting the same way goes back.  It needs `speakerguard-xlim.so`
on the LADSPA path.  Without it the speaker graph does not load, so there
is no speaker audio, never unprotected audio.
`tests/j700-xlim-graph.py` checks that the variant is the stock graph
with only the limiter added, and that the limiter's controls are the
J700's.  With `XLIM_SO` set to the built plugin it also checks every
control and port name against the plugin.

## Headphones and headset microphone

The 3.5 mm jack is a CS42L83 on `hw:AppleJ700,0`, described by the shared
laptop UCM verb, so the nodes, names and priorities are the stock ones.
The jack uses ALSA S24_LE (PipeWire S24_32LE) at 48 kHz: stereo output and
mono headset input.  The jack-detect controls make both routes available
only while something is plugged in.

The J700-specific part is the initial headphone volume: 0.001, or -60 dB
relative to jack full scale, which desktop volume sliders (cubic scale)
show as 10 %.  It is set with `device.routes.default-sink-volume` on the
card device.  A volume the user has already set takes precedence, and
there is no ceiling.

WirePlumber only selects routes that are available, so with nothing in
the jack the headphone node would get no route and report 100 % until
something is plugged in.  `asahi-unplugged-routes.lua`, enabled for the
built-in card of every Mac with `asahi.routes.select-unplugged`, selects
the unplugged headphone route anyway, so the node always shows the volume
the headphones will get: the stored one, or the default above.
WirePlumber does not store what is set on an unavailable route, so the
script also keeps the volume and mute set while nothing is plugged in
(`~/.local/state/wireplumber/asahi-unplugged-routes`) and applies them
whenever the route is selected, until they are changed again with
headphones in.

## Microphones

The microphones are on a second, capture-only card, `AppleJ700AOP` (driver
`t8140-aop-audio`, long name "MacBook Neo J700 AOP Audio"), not on macaudio.

**The microphone array** is PCM 1, `hpai`: two capsules, float32 (PipeWire
F32LE) at 48 kHz only.  It is the card's only UCM device ("Mic").  Like the
`AppleJxxxHPAI` cards of the other laptops, it is renamed
`alsa_input.platform-sound.RawMics`, hidden, and wrapped by the
`node.software-dsp` rule in `firs/j700/mic.json`.  The result is the
"MacBook Neo J700 Microphone" source, at the same priority as the other
machines' microphones.  The filter averages the two capsules, adds +24 dB of
make-up gain in two stages and applies the usual 120 Hz high-pass.  There is
no beamformer for a two-capsule array, and the gain is provisional until it
is calibrated against the other machines.

**The low-power microphone** is PCM 0, `lpai`.  It is not a user device:
it is absent from the UCM verb, and a WirePlumber rule disables any node on
PCM 0 of `AppleJ700AOP`, so no profile of the card (not even pro-audio) shows it.
It exists for developers working on always-on, low-power features such as
wake-word detection.

* ALSA device `hw:AppleJ700AOP,0`, capture only: S32_LE, 16 kHz, two
  channels, in fixed 200 ms periods (3200 frames, a buffer of two to four
  periods), for example:

      arecord -D hw:AppleJ700AOP,0 -f S32_LE -r 16000 -c 2 -d 5 lpmic.wav

* For a PipeWire source, link `firs/j700/lpmic-developer.conf` (installed as
  `/usr/share/asahi-audio/j700/lpmic-developer.conf`) into
  `~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/` and restart `pipewire` and
  `wireplumber`; the file has the exact commands.  This adds "Aurora
  Low-Power Microphone (developer)" (`alsa_input.j700-lpmic-developer`) at
  priority 1, so it never becomes the default while the array exists.
  Remove the link to turn it off again.

A WirePlumber state that saved the `pro-audio` profile for the AOP card
bypasses UCM and with it the microphone filter.  Select the card's default
profile (HiFi) again to get the "MacBook Neo J700 Microphone" back.
